<h1 style="text-align: center;">Our First Encounter</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;max-width: 75%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">From the Perspective of Jacob</h2>
<div style="text-align: justify;max-width: 75%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">The day started as a normal Saturday, except it ended unlike any other. The date was February 16th, 2019 and the evening was frigid, one that gave off every inkling of a bitter winter. As the sunlight dimmed, the red-tinted lights in the AXP house were fixed on. It was our annual Valentine's Day party, with music, food and drinks for everyone to enjoy! I was the newly elected Risk Manager for the fraternity, and I managed the position with great care. During events, I was responsible for monitoring the comings and goings of the attendees, which is precisely what I was doing when one guest entered, someone I had never seen before.

The mystery woman entered with great confidence as if she had owned the place. She took a glance at the scene in the living room before dashing upstairs, a place off-limits to the public. This immediately caught my attention, and I swiftly followed in her footsteps. To my surprise, I found the woman not where I would have expected, standing right in front of my bedroom door. I must have also caught her by surprise, as when I spoke up, "Excuse me, can I help you with something?", she jolted ever so slightly. "I'm looking for Jake's room" she replied. That didn't help narrow anything down, as there were four Jacobs who lived in the house, and I certainly had not invited anyone. Questioning her further, "Which one exactly?" She told me that her friend, who was dating one of the Jacobs, said to store her coat in Hoffmann's room. Instantly, I saw an opportunity and took it. "Oh I see. Well, his room is downstairs and, quite honestly, you don't want to store your stuff there. You never know when you will get back in there. Give me just a moment". I pulled out my keys, unlocked the bolt, and swung open the door. "You can keep it in here, it will be safe. I promise", giving her a smile of reassurance. Happily accepting, she smiled back and entered the room. This was the first time that I got a chance to look at her in proper lighting. Stunned by who was standing in front of me, the quip she made went right over my head. All I could think about now was getting to know this woman better, so to start the process I asked her name. "My name is Jacob, or as the brothers call me, Grabowski. It is very nice to meet you. What is your name?" She replied without hesitation. "I'm Rey".
