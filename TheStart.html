<h1 style="text-align: center;">Our First Encounter</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;max-width: 75%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">The day started out as a normal Saturday, except it ended unlike any other. The date was February 16th, 2019 and the evening was frigid, one that gave off every inkling of a bitter winter. As the sunlight dimmed, the red-tinted lights in the AXP house were fixed on. It was their annual Valentine's Day party, with music, food and drinks for everyone to enjoy! Jacob was the newly elected Risk Manager for the fraternity, and he managed the position with great care. He was responsible for monitoring the comings and goings of the attendees, which is precisely what he was doing when one guest entered, someone he had never seen before.

The mystery woman entered with great confidence as if she had owned the place. She took a quick glance at the scene in the living room before dashing upstairs, a place off-limits to the public. This caught the attention of Jacob, and he swiftly followed in her footsteps. To his surprise, he found the woman not where he had expected, standing right in front of his bedroom door. He must have also caught her by surprise, as when he spoke up, "Excuse me, can I help you with something?", she jolted ever so slightly. "I'm looking for Jake's room" she replied. That certainly didn't help narrow anything down, as there were four Jacobs who lived in the house, and this one had not invited anyone. He questioned further, "Which one exactly?" She told him that her friend, who was dating one of the Jacobs, said to store her coat in Hoffmann's room. He saw an opportunity and took it. "Oh I see. Well, his room is downstairs and, quite honestly, you don't want to store your stuff there. You never know when you will get back in there. Give me just a moment". He pulled out his keys, unlocked the bolt, and swung open the door. "You can keep it in here, it will be safe. I promise", giving her a smile of reassurance. Happily accepting, she smiled back and entered the room. This was the first time that Jacob got a chance to look at her in proper lighting. Stunned by who he saw in front of him, the quip she made towards him went right over his head. All he could think about now was getting to know this woman better, so to start the process he asked her name. "My name is Jacob, it's very nice to meet you, what is your name?" She replied without hesitation. "I'm Rey".
