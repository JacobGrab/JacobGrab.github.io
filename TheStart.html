<h1 style="text-align: center;">Our First Encounter</h1>
<div style="text-align: center;max-width: 75%;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">The day started out as a normal Saturday, except it ended unlike any other. The date was February 16th, 2019 and the evening was frigid, one that gave off every inkling of a bitter winter. As the sunlight dimmed, the red tinted lights in the AXP house were fixed on. It was their annual Valentine's Day party, with music, food and drinks for everyone to enjoy. Jacob was the newly elected Risk Manager for the fraternity, and he managed the position with great care. He was responsible for monitoring the comings and goings of the attendees, which is precisely what he was doing when one guest entered, someone he had never seen before.

This mystery woman entered with confidence like she had owned the place. She took a quick glance at the scene living room and made her way upstairs.
